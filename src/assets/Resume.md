Software Test Engineer
•	Using the C programming language and Windows’ libraries I created a test script to perform regression tests on positive and negative test cases. I created a serial connection using the window's libraries. A file handle was created, the baud rate was set and the data was parsed. I was given a user manual and created test cases based on the device. A time stamp was created at the beginning and end of every test case. Results went to a HTML document.
